We're so happy you could start a week early!
We just got approval on our hiring spend, but didn't want to
start bothering people on LinkedIn until you made some platform
decisions to help us with our search.

Can you get these back to us by the end of the day?

I know this is your first Lead role since being a senior engineer,
but we're sure you're going to nail it!

Besides, everyone else who applied for the position wanted
double what you were asking, so it's win-win, right?" 0 0
